## Overview

The Recon Tool Web Application is a simple yet effective tool for scanning web applications for vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations. It consists of a user interface where users can log in with their credentials and then run a scan on a specified target. The application simulates a scanning process, generating results for demonstration purposes.

## Features

User authentication: Users need to log in with their credentials (username and password) to access the scanning functionality.
Scan Types: Users can select from various scan types, including "Vulnerability Scanning," "Security Misconfiguration Scan," and "SSL/TLS Analysis."
Progress Tracking: A progress bar displays the scan progress, indicating the status of the scanning process.
Scan Results: The application presents scan results in a table format, showing the target name and the scan result.
Detailed Scan Interface: Users can select a specific target from the result table to open a new interface displaying the detailed scan results.
Save Scan Reports: Users can retrieve scan reports and save them to a chosen storage location for future reference.
Installation
The Recon Tool Web Application is built using Java Swing and does not require any specific installation steps. However, it does require Java to be installed on your system to run. Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed before running the application.

## Code


## Usage

Clone or download the application to your local system.
Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and run the following command to start the application:
''' bash
  Copy code
  java ReconToolUI '''
The application will open with a login interface. Use the following credentials to log in:

Username: user
Password: scan
- Once logged in, the main scanning interface will appear, allowing you to select a target and scan type. Click the "Run" button to start the scanning process.

- The progress bar will indicate the scanning progress. After the scan is completed, the results will be displayed in the table.

- To view detailed scan results, click on a target from the result table. A new interface will open with the scan details.

- To save scan reports, click the "Retrieve Reports" button on the scan details interface. Choose a storage location, and the scan reports will be saved as a text file.

## How It Works

The Recon Tool Web Application is built using Java Swing and simulates a scanning process. The application provides a login interface where users need to enter their credentials. Upon successful login, users are granted access to the main scanning interface.

The main interface allows users to select a target and a scan type. After clicking the "Run" button, the scanning process is initiated. The application simulates the scanning process by updating the progress bar.

Upon completion of the scan, the application displays the scan results in a table. Users can click on a specific target in the table to open a new interface showing the detailed scan results for that target.

The "Retrieve Reports" button on the detailed scan interface allows users to save the scan reports as a text file in a chosen storage location.

Please note that the scan results generated by this application are simulated for demonstration purposes only and do not reflect actual scan results.
